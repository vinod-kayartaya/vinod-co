## Additional features of Spring Boot

Spring Boot offers a number of additional features that can help you develop and deploy your application more efficiently and effectively.

One of these features is the ability to customize the startup and runtime behavior of your application using application properties and configuration files. Spring Boot provides support for a variety of configuration file formats, including properties files, YAML files, and JSON files.

You can use application properties to configure a wide range of aspects of your application, such as the server port, the database connection, and the logging level. For example, you can use the following application properties to configure the server port and the logging level:

```yaml
server.port=8080
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
```

You can also use configuration files to define custom configuration properties and bind them to classes using the @ConfigurationProperties annotation.

Another feature of Spring Boot is the ability to create and manage application dependencies using Spring Boot starters. Spring Boot starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application to automatically configure the required dependencies.

For example, to include the spring-boot-starter-web dependency in your application, you can add the following to your Maven build configuration:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

This dependency includes a number of other dependencies that are required for building web applications, such as the Spring MVC framework, the Tomcat web server, and the Jackson JSON library.

Spring Boot also offers a number of features to help you deploy your application more efficiently and effectively. For example, you can use the Spring Boot Actuator to monitor and manage your application in production, and you can use the Spring Boot Developer Tools to quickly reload changes to your application during development.

Spring Boot also provides support for a number of popular application architectures and technologies, such as microservices, cloud-native applications, and reactive programming.

For example, you can use the spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb dependency to include the required dependencies for accessing MongoDB databases in your application, or you can use the spring-boot-starter-data-redis dependency to include the required dependencies for accessing Redis databases.

You can also use the spring-boot-starter-webflux dependency to include the required dependencies for building reactive web applications using the Spring WebFlux framework.

Overall, Spring Boot offers a wide range of additional features that can help you develop and deploy your application more efficiently and effectively.
