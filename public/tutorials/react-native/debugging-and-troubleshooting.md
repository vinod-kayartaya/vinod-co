Debugging and troubleshooting are important tasks that developers need to perform when building apps with React Native. There are several tools and techniques that can be used to help identify and fix problems in a React Native app.

One useful tool for debugging React Native apps is the React Native Debugger, which is a standalone debugger that can be used to inspect the state of a React Native app. The React Native Debugger allows developers to inspect the component tree, view the props and state of components, and see the console output of an app.

Another useful tool for debugging React Native apps is the React Native Developer Menu, which is a menu that is built into the app and can be accessed by shaking the device or using a special gesture. The Developer Menu provides a range of options for debugging and troubleshooting, such as the ability to enable hot reloading, inspect the component tree, and view the performance of an app.

In addition to these tools, developers can also use standard debugging techniques such as logging output to the console and using the debugger keyword in their code to stop execution at a specific point.

Overall, there are several tools and techniques that can be used to help debug and troubleshoot a React Native app. The React Native Debugger and Developer Menu are both useful tools, and standard debugging techniques such as logging output and using the debugger keyword can also be helpful.
